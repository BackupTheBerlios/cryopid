<h1>CryoPID - A Process Freezer for Linux</h1>

<p>CryoPID allows you to capture the state of a running process in Linux
and save it to a file. This file can then be used to resume the process
later on, either after a reboot or even on another machine.</p>

<h2><a name="status">Status</a></h2>

<p>CryoPID is a fairly new project, spawned out of a discussion on the
<a href="http://swsusp.sf.net/">Software suspend</a> mailing list about
the complexities of suspending and resuming individual processes.</p>

<p>Currently, there are two programs that do the work. The first is
<b>savestate</b> that captures a running process to a file. It is written in C
and probably relatively portable between Linuxes. The second program is
<b>resume</b> which takes the file saved previously and restores the program.
It is currently written in assembly, highly i386-Linux specific, and error
reporting is non-existent.</p>

<p>The current aim is to rewrite the resumer in C to allow for portability and
easier extensibility.</p>

<h2><a name="features">Features</a></h2>
<p>Current features are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Works! (except for the caveats above)</li>
 <li>Can run as an ordinary user! (no root privileges needed)</li>
 <li>Can start &amp; stop a process multiple times</li>
 <li>Can migrate processes between machines!!!! (tested!)
   (either by saving all libraries to the image, or ensuring libraries are
   identical on both machines).</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="issues">Known Issues</a></h2>
<p>Current known issues are (brain dump from mailing list):</p>
<ul>

  <li>The PID will change upon resume. Possible solutions:
  <ul>
    <li>Virtualized pids with some liberal use of LD_PRELOADs.</li>
    <li>Notice the PID is free and then keep on fork()'ing until you get that PID (ICK!)</li>
    <li>Get some help from kernel space to request a given PID</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Open file handles are a work in progess. Support for capturing the file
    descriptors is there, but not their offsets yet (involve ptracing and inserting some code to run an lseek()). The resuming process doesn't yet handle it,
    again not very hard, but the C rewrite has priority.
  </li>

  <li>
    Sockets - no idea how on earth to handle open connections. Listening sockets
    are probably possible though.
  </li>

  <li>
     Terminal status is not restored. Some applications (eg, vim) can
     do this for you though. Doing it externally would be nice(tm).
  </li>

  <li>
     One process only (haven't tested on threads, and it can't capture more
     than one process at a time yet).
  </li>

  <li>
    Process name in ps gets garbled upon resume. Haven't figured this
    out yet either, though probably isn't difficult.
  </li>

  <li>
     PAX must be turned off if you have it (chpax -xperms &lt;target program&gt;)
  </li>

  <li>
    Executables &amp; Libraries must be identical on resumed state as
    suspended state.
  </li>

  <li>
    It runs in memory location 0x00100000 so if a real process wants
    to use this location, it will choke. Hopefully not too many do
    though.
  </li>

  <li>
    Behaviour when interrupted mid-syscall is undefined (I haven't
    figured out what actually happens yet :)
  </li>

  <li>
    Really unreliable on 2.6.... working on it. If anybody knows what the memory segment below is, please contact me :)<br>
<pre>ffffd000-ffffe000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0 </pre>
  </li>

  <li> 
    Resumer gives next to no error reporting.
  </li>

  <li>
    Very undocumented.
  </li>
  
</ul>

<p>So by this point you're probably saying, "Yeah right, that's impossible".
Show me. Files are currently at

until the next release.
